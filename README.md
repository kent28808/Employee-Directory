## Description
This application uses randomuser.me api to populate an employee directory with random employee photos, names, emails, phone numbers and locations.  
As a user, I can search for specific employees in the search form bar, which will bring up the specific employee information for that individual.
The table header first and last names will also sort employees alphabetically if the first and last name table header are clicked.
